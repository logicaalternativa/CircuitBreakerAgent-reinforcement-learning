Reinforcement learning Circuit Breaker implementation

The idea is to adapt Reinforcement Learning to Resilience patterns as the Circuit Breaker pattern. This will allow to get the best configuration that donâ€™t depends on the user experiencein order to get the best performance .
Reinforcement Learning could be applied in this branch of software. This will help to get better reactive and resilience architectures. This project is based on adapt the Q-Learning model to this pattern and its validation.
